For running you need
````
composer
mysql v8
````

First run command

````angular2html
composer i
````

after that setup your .env file. You can use from .env.example and setup only db configs.

Run command

````angular2html
php artisan serve
````

I wrote decorator part on the trait, and you can use it everywhere. Just you need change namespace of file.
